    <h1>Literature Fingerprints</h1>
    <p>Use this page to upload a collection of different text documents and visualize their "fingerprints". To generate the fingerprint, the text files are broken up into shorter lists of words. For each subset, we draw a small box and set the color of the box based on the average word length for all of the words in that subset.
